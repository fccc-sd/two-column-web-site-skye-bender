                    Hello! my name is Skylar.
                    I was born and raised in Ohio, around the Toledo area. 
                    I went to Meadowvale Elementary School, with plans on going to
                    Whitmer High, but got transfered to Four County Career Center 
                    where I now reside. I've been interesting in computer science 
                    for a long time, so now I've decided to take the Computer 
                    Programming course with Matt Geiger. I have plans on going to 
                    college for software engineering.

                </p>

                <h2 id="firstH2"><strong>Chapter 1 :</strong> Hobbies</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I have many interests and hobbies; however, I've always specifically loved making art, <a href="pages/page2.html" title="Artworks I've made">and have made many works.</a>  I have been drawing since I was a young child, and now enjoy making large realistc portraits with charcoal as my medium.
                    even though that may be my favorite medium, I do still enjoy making and observing most types of art. Other art mediums I've dabbled in are <em>Digital, Painting, Oil Pastels, Graphic Design, Music Production,</em> etc.

                </p>    
        
                <p>
                    Over the years of making art, I have gathered my own opinions on what I think are the coolest art mediums. Here are those mediums ordered from coolest to least cool:   
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other hobbies I participate in include, <em>coding </em>(obviously), <em>writing, playing and making video games, fitness, and cooking.</em> Cooking especially has always been another interest of mine, I've always loved trying new dishes and experimenting.
                </p>
    
                <h2> <strong>Chapter 2:</strong> Extracurriculars</h2>
    
                <p>
                    I haven't participated in many after-school activities, but I have enrolled in a few. When I was in elementary school, <em>I was on the bowling team.</em> I had been bowling many times before, and thought it would be fun to be on the bowling team at my school.
                    I have also been in my school's <em>junior softball team</em> around the time of 2nd or 3rd grade. This definitely was not my favorite sport, as I mainly just sat in the outfield and played with the grass, but I suppose I am greatful for the experiences I endured.
                    Finally, there was a program at my elementary school where every other friday, you and your family could go to the nearby <em>rollerskating rink</em> for free. This wasn't technically an "extracurricular activity," but it was related to my school,
                    as well as being hosted after school, so I consider it an extracurricular activity.
                </p>
            
                <h2> <strong>Chapter 3:</strong> Family History</h2>
                
                <p>
                    My family has always been somewhat complicated, but I love my family nontheless. I live with <em>my mother, my brother, and my step-father.</em> I also visit my <em>biological father</em> often. I have a very good relationship with my brother, I consider him to be my best friend. 
                    On my biological father's side of the family, I have many relatives. I have <em>my father, my step-mother, and four half-brothers.</em> as well as multiple uncles and aunts, many cousins, and a few grandparents as well. Not to mention the amount of family friends my father has. On my mother's side of the family however, there aren't
                    nearly as many close relatives. I have my mother, my grandparents, my aunt and uncle, and my three cousins. I have other extended family, but I do not see them nearly as much.
